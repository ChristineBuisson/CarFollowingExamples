# CarFollowingExamples

The basic idea is to have a place to share with my students the code I created to model and reproduce car following on an highway. I plan to have several tests with this: 
- a dataset analysis; 
- a groups of the most famous CF models one can find in literature; 
- a calibration and validation example. 

The ultimate idea, after this first step, is to contribute to create a branch of reproducible research in transportation modelling and traffic flow theory area.
